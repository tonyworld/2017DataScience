## Synopsis
Severe weather events like storms pose a threat to both human lives and public property. Here, an exploratory analysis was conducted with the data of [major weather events during 1950-2011](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) from U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. Due to the inconsistency and abbreviation, the recorded event types were matched to 48 weather types based on [the storm data documentation](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf). The fatalities, injuries and damages were then calculated for each event type. The analysis results show that tornado caused the most fatalities and injuries, while flood caused the most economic damages.
